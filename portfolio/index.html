<h2>Skillcrushstarter</h2>
<p>First try at a Wordpress page and what <br> did I learn? Installing Wordpress locally, exploring admin, installing a theme, PHP coding for modifying pages and posts, downloading and installing plugins, and using CSS, HTML, and PHP to personalize your website. Good chunk of new skills

services.</p>
