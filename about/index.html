<p>Hi, my name is Laura, and I am creative, which means I like to both code and put colours and fonts together in visual presentation. I also have a passion for animals and their welfare, and would love to help out shelters or any other animal-related establishments.</p>

<p>So what can I do for you and what does this process look like?</p>
<p>For a website, I start with a wireframe with text boxes, squares and other shapes for placement your logo, pictures, and other elements. Next, after that is approved, I will send you pictures of the mockup pages, with your logo and other elements instead of the shapes.
After that is approved, I start coding for your website, sending you weekly screenshots as it progresses. When thatâ€™s done, I will either hand it over to you to find a domain, or I will find a domain for you, depending on what we initially discussed in the discovery call
before this process begins. Progress on all stages will be sent to you weekly for approval and/or tweaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="half-width">
<p>For a logo, I start out with sketches from brainstorming after the design brief I send to you to fill out is sent back. I will send you three to four sketches to pick from, and once you have picked one, you will get a black and white version to see if you like it. If
approved, I will colour it with chosen colours from the design brief, and send it to you to see what you think. Again, progress shots will be sent weekly.</p>
<p>Business card will have logo and address, including phone number and web address, and e-mail on one side, and services on the other side. Letterhead contains logo on one side, and address, phone number, web address and e-mail on the other side; letterhead goes in the
header of printed and digital letters or other business documents. I can also put together brochures or other paper or digital pieces showcasing your services.</p>
